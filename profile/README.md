## Ahoy, this is Orcasound ðŸ‘‹

### Our voyage thus far

Since an [Orcasound Kickstarter in 2017](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sveirs/orcasound-listen-for-whales), we have been building open source software here on Github to help save orcas that seek salmon along the west coast of North America. Experiencing the sounds of endangered Southern Resident killer whales and acting to help conserve them is at the ðŸ’— heart of our collective collaboration.

We began with an end-to-end audio streaming solution to make it easy to *listen for whales* through the [Orcasound network of underwater microphones](https://orcasound.net) ("hydrophones") in orca habitat. The [orcanode repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode) generates the audio data streams and the [orcasite repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite) provides a web app for playback that "just works" in any browser and scales efficiently. 

From the beginning, we have benefited greatly from the amazing all-volunteer **hackathon** community -- mainly through the organizational efforts of [DemocracyLab](https://www.democracylab.org/projects/81) and [Microsoft Garage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/) through in-person events in/near Seattle (Washington, USA) as well as many virtual events during the COVID pandemic. Both Microsoft's [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program and [Amazon Activate](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/) have supported our efforts with grants and cloud service credits. Starting in 2020, we have mentored Google Summer of Code students here (see the [orcagsoc repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc)). 

### Welcome aboard!

Would you like to help save the orcas and contribute to open source software? 

The Orcasound organisation on Github has a growing number of projects to which coders (front/back end developers, bioacousticians) and designers can contribute. As our community expands, there are also roles for project managers, mentors, and hardware engineers. Our community is super-friendly, communication mainly happens on Slack, and there are weekly meetings where you can introduce yourself and listen in to what others are doing. 

Here is the [current onboarding doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pjh5juthsG0sv7hYCtwgeXgNSlkmIt0p0bw17Y4VXco/edit#heading=h.qybrobkq5dm5) where you can find more info about our current motivation, high-priority projects, and how to join our community.
